## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After successfully installing the necessary dependencies and setting up the environment, you can start ShynoBot on both Linux and Windows by executing the following command:
```
node start.js
```

Upon launching the bot, you will be presented with two options:
1. **Activate the bot using an Activation Key:** This is the first option that will be available to you. After purchasing the bot, you will be provided with an activation key. Use this key to start and operate your bot.
2. **Regenerate an Activation Code:** If you ever need to regenerate an activation code, you will need the old activation code and a password. These details will be provided to you upon purchase. It's important to note that the password is not the same as your Discord password. Instead, it's a unique password that I provide for the purpose of code regeneration.

Please keep both your activation code and password safe and secure. For any further queries or support, feel free to reach out to me directly.
